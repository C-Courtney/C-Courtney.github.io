      <h1>Simple Pie Crust Recipe</h1>
      <p>
        Every pie needs a good quality crust, and that's exactly what this is.
        Sweet and buttery, this crust is perfect for both sweet and savoury
        pies! <br />
        <strong>Prep time:</strong> 15 minutes <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 0

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>6 tbsp unsalted butter, chilled and cubed</li>
        <li>2/3 cup vegetable shortning, chilled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water, ice cold</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk flower and salt together.</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add the butter and shortening. Using a pastry cutter or two forks, cut
          the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse
          meal (pea-sized bits with a few larger bits of fat is OK). In this
          step, you’re only breaking up the cold fat into tiny little
          flour-coated pieces; you’re not completely incorporating it. Do not
          overwork the ingredients.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water in a cup. Add ice. Stir it around.
          From that, measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water, since the ice has melted
          a bit. Drizzle the cold water in, 1 Tablespoon (15ml) at a time, and
          stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon after every Tablespoon has
          been added. Stop adding water when the dough begins to form large
          clumps. I always use about 1/2 cup of water, and need a little more in
          dry winter months. Do not add any more water than you need.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Transfer the pie dough to a floured work surface. Using floured hands,
          fold the dough into itself until the flour is fully incorporated into
          the fats. The dough should come together easily and should not feel
          overly sticky. Avoid overworking the dough. If it feels a bit too dry
          or crumbly, dip your fingers in the ice water and then continue
          bringing dough together with your hands. If it feels too sticky,
          sprinkle on more flour and then continue bringing dough together with
          your hands. Form it into a ball. Use a sharp knife to cut it in half.
          If it’s helpful, you should have about 1 lb, 8 ounces dough total
          (about 680g). Gently flatten each half into 1-inch-thick discs using
          your hands.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours
          and up to 5 days.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          After the dough has chilled for at least 2 hours, you can roll it out.
          Work with one crust at a time, keeping the other in the refrigerator
          until you’re ready to roll it out. Lightly flour the work surface,
          rolling pin, and your hands, and sprinkle a little flour on top of the
          dough. Use gentle-medium force with your rolling pin on the
          dough—don’t press down too hard on the dough; you’re not mad at it!
          When rolling dough out, start from the center and work your way out in
          all directions, turning the dough with your hands as you go. Between
          passes of the rolling pin, rotate the pie crust and even flip it, to
          make sure it’s not sticking to your work surface. Sprinkle on a little
          more flour if it’s sticking; don’t be afraid to use a little more
          flour. If you notice the dough becoming a lopsided circle as you’re
          rolling it out, put down the rolling pin and use your hands to help
          mold the dough back into an even circle. Roll the dough into a very
          thin 12-inch circle, which is the perfect size to fit a 9-inch pie
          dish. Your pie dough will be about 1/8 inch thick, which is quite
          thin. Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly
          normal and expected.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Because your dough is so thin, use your rolling pin to help transfer
          the pie crust to the pie dish. Carefully roll one end of the circle of
          dough gently onto the rolling pin, rolling it back towards you, slowly
          peeling it off the work surface as you go. Pick it up, and carefully
          roll it back out over the top of the pie dish.
        </li>
