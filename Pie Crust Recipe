    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pie crust</li>
      <li>3 cups sliced rhubarb</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups chopped strawberries</li>
      <li>1/3 cup brown suger, lightly packed</li>
      <li>1/3 cup granulated suger</li>
      <li>1/4 cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tbsp orange juice</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten with 1 tbsp milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Make 2 pie crusts</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        tir the rhubarb, strawberries, brown sugar, granulated sugar,
        cornstarch, salt, orange juice, and vanilla extract together in a large
        bowl. Set filling aside as the oven preheats.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Roll out the chilled pie dough: On a floured work surface, roll out one
        of the discs of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator).
        Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have
        a circle 12 inches in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch
        pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. Spoon
        the filling into the crust, leaving all of the excess liquid in the bowl
        (you don’t want that in the filling—discard it). Dot the pieces of
        butter on top of the filling.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Arrange the lattice: Remove the other disc of chilled pie dough from the
        refrigerator. Roll the dough into a circle that is 12 inches diameter.
        Using a pastry wheel, sharp knife, or pizza cutter, cut strips 1/2- to
        1-inch wide. Carefully thread the strips over and under one another,
        pulling back strips as necessary to weave. Press the edges of the strips
        into the bottom pie crust edges to seal. Use a small knife to trim off
        excess dough. Crimp the pie crust edges with a fork, if desired.
        (Alternatively, you can simply cover the filling with the 12-inch pie
        dough circle. Cut slits in the top to form steam vents. Trim and crimp
        the edges. Or a crumble or streusel topping would be great.)
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place the pie onto a large baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Keeping
        the pie in the oven, turn the temperature down to 350°F (177°C) and bake
        for an additional 30-35 minutes. After the first 20 minutes of bake
        time, I place a pie crust shield on top of the pie to prevent the edges
        from browning too quickly.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Allow the pie to cool for 3 full hours at room temperature before
        serving. This time allows the filling to thicken up. Cover leftovers
        tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
      </li>
      <br />
    </ol>
