  <h1>How To Make a Pie</h1>

  <h3>Oveview</h3>
  
  <p>There are a <strong>lot</strong> of different types of pie. There are swwet pies and savoury pies, meat pies and fruit pies. Even <em>vegetible</em> pies! However! Rather than being defined by their fillings, pies are difined by their crust. 
<br>A filled pie (also single-crust or bottom-crust), has pastry lining the baking dish, and the filling is placed on top of the pastry but left open. 
<br>A top-crust pie has the filling in the bottom of the dish and is covered with a pastry or other covering before baking. 
<br>A two-crust pie has the filling completely enclosed in the pastry shell. Shortcrust pastry is a typical kind of pastry used for pie crusts, but many things can be used, including baking powder biscuits, mashed potatoes, and crumbs.</p>
