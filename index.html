      There are a <strong>lot</strong> of different types of pie. There are
      sweet pies and savoury pies, meat pies and fruit pies. Even
      <em>vegetable</em> pies! However! Rather than being defined by their
      fillings, pies are defined by their crust. <br />A filled pie (also
      single-crust or bottom-crust), has pastry lining the baking dish, and the
      filling is placed on top of the pastry but left open. <br />A top-crust
      pie has the filling in the bottom of the dish and is covered with a pastry
      or other covering before baking. <br />
      A two-crust pie has the filling completely enclosed in the pastry shell.
      Shortcrust pastry is a typical kind of pastry used for pie crusts, but
      many things can be used, including baking powder biscuits, mashed
      potatoes, and crumbs. Read more on the origins of pie

      <h2>Pie Crust Techniques</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      There are lots of different techniques to keep in mind when when making a
      pie crust, so here are a few of them.
    </p>
    <div class="head">
      <h4>While making the pie crust:</h4>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The heat of the butter as it "Kneads" to be cool (get it? But don't
        actually knead your pie dough unless the recipe specifically calls for
        it)
      </li>
      <li>
        And how well it's forming clumps and how well the clumps are coming
        together
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="head">
      <h4>While rolling out the dough:</h4>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To roll the dough in a circle, roll the rolling pin in an arc, turning
        the dough as needed
      </li>
      <li>
        If some places are too long for the pie dish and others too short, cut
        of the long pieces using a butter knife, and when you attach it to the
        other piece, make little hatch marks all around it first,
        <em>then</em> press down
      </li>
    </ul>
